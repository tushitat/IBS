The 260 amino acid synthetic sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phospho-oligonucleotide end products(without affecting intracellular DNA). In individuals with cystic fibrosis, extracellular DNA, an extremely viscous anion, is released by degenerating leukocytes which accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA causes reduction in sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.",Used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis as adjunct therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. These thick secretions contribute to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity. The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection, nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals. ",Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human DNase I. The enzyme is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phospho-oligonucleotide end products. It has no effect on intracellular DNA. Optimal activity dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. Extracellular DNA is a viscous anionic polymer and its breakdown appears to improve the viscosity and viscoelasticity of purulent sputum of individuals with CF. ,"Adverse reactions occur at a rate of 1/1000 and are usually mild and transient in nature.

The difference  between anakinra and the native human IL-1Ra is that anakinra has an extra methionine residue at the amino terminus. It is manufactured by using the E. coli expression system. Anakinra is composed of 153 amino acid residues. FDA approved on November 14, 2001. ",To treat adult rheumatoid arthritis and Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID).,"Anakinra blocks the biologic activity of IL-1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses including inflammatory and immunological responses. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have elevated levels of IL-1. The levels of the naturally occurring IL-1Ra in synovium and synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are not sufficient to compete with the elevated amount of locally produced IL-1.

The structure is identical to native human insulin. Recombinant insulin is synthesized by recombinant DNA techncology. Inserting the human insulin gene into the Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces insulin for human use. ",Indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Insulin regular is a short-acting insulin. When subcutaneously administered, the onset of action (as evidenced by a decrease in glucose level) occurs 30 minutes post-dose. Maximal effect occurs between 1.5 and 3.5 hours post-dose. The glucose-lowering effect occurs 8 hours post-dose. Compared to other rapid-acting insulin analogs, insulin regular has a slower onset of action and longer duration of action. ","The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty  acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism.",Hypoglycemia is caused due to insulin toxicity.,Predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.,Generally well absorbed.,0.15 L/kg,N.A.,Antidiabetic Agents,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,http://www.drugs.com/mtm/novolin-r.html,229606921210,Th1028,Tenecteplase,SYQVICRDEKTQMIYQQHQSWLRPVLRSNRVEYCWCNSGRAQCHSVPVKSCSEPRCFNGGTCQQALYFSDFVCQCPEGFAGKCCEIDTRATCYEDQGISYRGNWSTAESGAECTQWNSSALAQKPYSGRRPDAIRLGLGNHNYCRNPDRDSKPWCYVFKAGKYSSEFCSTPACSEGNSDCYFGNGSAYRGTHSLTESGASCLPWNSMILIGKVYTAQNPSAQALGLGKHNYCRNPDGDAKPWCHVLKNRRLTWEY,Ib,58951.2,C2561H3919N747O781S40,7.61,-0.528,60,"1.9 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro)","Tenecteplase(527 amino acid) is a glycoprotein developed by introducing the following modifications to the complementary DNA for natural human tPA: a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine, and a substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine, both within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296-299 in the protease domain.",To treat myocardial infarction and lysis of intracoronary emboli.,"Tenecteplase is a fibrin-specific tissue-plasminogen activator.

Plasmid DNA transfected into the bacteria encodes for an analogue of human insulin that has a lysine at residuce B28 and proline at B29; these residues are reversed in endogenous human insulin. Reversal of these amino acid residues produces a rapid-acting insulin analogue. FDA approved on 1996. ,To treat type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. To be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin except when used in a continuous insulin infusion pump.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  ","Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor(IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic  to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1.

Plasmid DNA transfected into the bacteria encodes for an analogue of human insulin that has a lysine at residuce B28 and proline at B29; these residues are reversed in endogenous human insulin. Reversal of these amino acid residues produces a rapid-acting insulin analogue. FDA approved on 1996. ,To treat type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. To be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin except when used in a continuous insulin infusion pump.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  ","Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor(IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic  to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and -cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells.

Injections of imiglucerase into Gaucher disease patients leads to elevated serum levels of the enzyme and reduction in the accumulation of glucocerebroside leading to reduced anemia and thrombocytopenia, reduced spleen and liver size, and decreased cachexia.","Imiglucerase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycolipid, glucocerebroside, to glucose and ceramide as part of the normal degradation pathway for membrane lipids.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,0.09 to 0.15 L/kg,14.5 ± 4.0 mL/min/kg,Enzyme Replacement Agents,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,http://www.rxlist.com/cerezyme-drug.htm,"19265748, 25501675, 24612151, 24411065, 23430813, 20336596, 24950666, 24630271, 19277123"1327,Th1046,Abciximab,H ReoPro-like antibody Heavy Chain 1: EVQLQQSGAELVKPGASVKLSCTASGFNIKDTYVHWVKQRPEQGLEWIGRIDPANGYTKYDPKFQGKATITADTSSNTAYLQLSSLTSEDTAVYYCVRPLYDYYAMDYWGQGTSVTVSSAKTTAPSVYPLAPVCGDTTGSSVTLGCLVKGYFPEPVTLTWNSGSLSSGVHTFPAVLQSDLYTLSSSVTVTSSTWPSQSITCNVAHPASSTKVDKKIE,IIa,145651.1,C6462H9964N1690O2049S48,6.16,-0.424,71,"Following intravenous bolus administration, free plasma concentrations of Abciximab decrease rapidly with an initial half-life of less than 10 minutes and a second phase half-life of about 0.5 hours, probably related to rapid binding to the platelet GPIIb","Abciximab is a Fab fragment of the chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody 7E3.

Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. The sulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrate dermatan sulfate, throughout the body. This accumulation leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Galsulfase is intended to provide an exogenous enzyme that will be taken up into lysosomes and increase the catabolism of GAG. Galsulfase uptake by cells into lysosomes is most likely mediated by the binding of mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of galsulfase to specific mannose-6-phosphate receptors.","Galsulfase supplies recombinant-engineered galsulfase, a normal variant form of the polymorphic human enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes the cleavage of the sulfate ester from terminal N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues of GAG chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate.

The Fc portion of the drug consists of the hinge region, the CH2 domain, and the CH3 domain of IgG1. Although there are multiple pathways and cell types involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, evidence suggests that T-cell activation may play an important role in the immunopathology of the disease. Ordinarily, full T-cell activation requires binding of the T-cell receptor to an antigen-MHC complex on the antigen-presenting cell as well as a co-stimulatory signal provided by the binding of the CD28 protein on the surface of the T-cell with the CD80/86 proteins on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. CTLA4 is a naturally occurring protein which is expressed on the surface of T-cells some hours or days after full T-cell activation and is capable of binding to CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells with much greater affinity than CD28. Binding of CTLA4-Ig to CD80/86 provides a negative feedback mechanism which results in T-cell deactivation.

This results in a decreased hexamer formation and higher rate of absorption, compared to wild type insulin, following subcutaneous administration.",For the treatment of Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. Should normally be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin aspart is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60-90 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.","Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action.","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia.

Should normally be used in conjunction with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.,"Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin aspart is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60-90 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.","Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action.","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia.

Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin aspart is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60-90 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.","Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action.","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling.

In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis.

In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin glulisine is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin glulisine is approximately 15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 2-4 hours.","Insulin glulisine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action.","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia. Neurogenic (autonomic) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, hunger, nausea and tingling.

Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action.","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia.

In various in vitro assays, thymosin alpha 1 has been shown to promote T-cell differentiation and maturation; for example, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cells have all been shown to be increased. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to increase production of IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, and expression of IL-2 receptor following activation by mitogens or antigens, increase NK cell activity, increase production of migratory inhibitory factor (MIF), and increase antibody response to T-cell dependent antigens. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to antagonize dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of thymocytes in vitro. In vivo administration of thymosin alpha 1 to animals immunosuppressed by chemotherapy, tumor burden, or irradiation showed that thymosin alpha 1 protects against cytotoxic damage to bone marrow, tumor progression and opportunistic infections, thereby increasing survival time and number of survivors. Many of the in vitro and in vivo effects of thymosin alpha 1 have been interpreted as influences on either differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to thymocytes or activation of thymocytes into activated T-cells. Thymalfasin also has been shown in vitro to upregulate expression of toll like receptors (TLR) including TLR2 and TLR9 in mouse and human dendritic cells, as well as activate NF-kB and JNK/P38/AP1 pathways.

This is achieved by the acute effects of the hormone on calcium resorption in bone and calcium reabsorption in the kidney. The phosphate mobilized from bone is excreted into the urine by means of the hormone's influence on renal phosphate handling. Parathyroid hormone also stimulates calcium absorption in the intestine, this being mediated indirectly by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, a hypocalcemic stimulus of parathyroid hormone secretion results in an increased influx of calcium from three sources (bone, kidney, and intestine), resulting in a normalization of the serum calcium concentration without change in the serum phosphate concentration.","The biological actions of rhPTH are mediated through binding to at least two distinct high- affinity cell-surface receptors specific for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the molecule, both of which are required for normal bone metabolism.

The fragments derived from the amino-terminus are further degraded within the cell while the fragments derived from the carboxy-terminus are released back into the blood and cleared by the kidney. These carboxy-terminal fragments are thought to play a role in the regulation of PTH activity. Under normal physiological conditions full-length PTH constitutes only 5-30% of the circulating forms of the molecule, while 70-95% is present as carboxy-terminal fragments.

It is a mixture of several compounds majorly teicoplanin A2-1 through A2-5, along with four minor ones, teicoplanin RS-1 through RS-4.

The components also contain a third carbohydrate moiety, _-D-glucosamine, and differ only by the length and conformation of a side chain attached to it. ",For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.,"Teicoplanin is an antibiotic used in the prophylaxis and treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. It is a glycopeptide antiobiotic extracted from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, with a similar spectrum of activity to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.

After purification, their structures were found to be new teicoplanin-like molecules, bearing 8-hydroxydecanoic and 9-hydroxydecanoic acyl moieties. This metabolic transformation is likely due to hydroxylation in the omega-2 and omega-1 positions for metabolites 1 and 2, respectively, of the C-10 linear side chain of component A2-3.

It is an antineoplastic agent developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults. Ipilimumab received FDA approval on March 25, 2011.",Ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults.,"The pharmacodynamics of Ipilimumab are not completely understood. In melanoma patients receiving Ipilimumab, the mean peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) increased throughout the induction dosing period. This increase occurred in a dose-dependent fashion in Phase 2 studies. Ipilimumab given with or without gp100 at 3 mg/kg increased ALC throughout the induction dosing period, but no meaningful change in ALC occurred in the control group who received an investigational peptide vaccine alone. Furthermore, ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4 with high affinity (Kd = 5.24 ± 3.62 nM). As a result, ligands CD80 and CD86 are blocked from binding to CTLA-4 with a minimum EC50 value of 0.2 _g/mL.","Ipilimumab is a fully human IgG1K antibody that binds to CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4), a molecule on T-cells that is indicated for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The absence or presence of CTLA-4 can augment or suppress the immune system's T-cell response in fighting disease. Ipilimumab is designed to block the activity of CTLA-4, thereby sustaining an active immune response in its attack on cancer cells. The proposed mechanism of action is indirect, and may be through T-cell - mediated anti-tumor immune responses. ","Therapy with Ipilimumab can result in severe and fatal immune reactions due to T-cell proliferation and activation. These reactions may occur in multiple organ systems, but common reactions include enterecolitis, dermatitis (including toxic necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. Patients should be assessed for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus/blood in stool), bowel perforation (petitoneal signs and ileus), hepatitis, dermatitis (rash and pruritus), motor or sensory neuropathy (unilateral/bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, or paresthesia) , hypophysitis/adrenal insufficiency including adrenal crisis/hyper- or hypothyroidism (fatigue, mental status change, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, hypotension) and should have liver function tests and thyroid function tests performed at baseline and prior to each dose. Typically immune mediated adverse reactions manifest during therapy, however, a minority of reactions occurred after discontinuation of ipilimumab. In one study of neuropathies, one case of fatal Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome occurred, and once case of severe peripheral neuropathy (Grade 3) was reported. During clinical development of ipilimumab additional cases of Guillain-BarrÃ© and myasthenia gravis have been reported. In severe neuropathy, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent. In one study, severe or potentially fatal dermatitis (eg, Steven-Johnsons syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) occured in 2.5% (n=13). The median time of onset of moderate to potentially fatal dermatitis was 3.1 weeks (up to 17.3 weeks). Treatment of 54% of severe dermatitis cases (n=7) involved high dose topical corticosteriods. 6 patients had complete resolution in up to 15.6 weeks. Permanently discontinue ipilimumab in patients with SJS or TEN, and withhold the dose in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms. Mild- moderate dermatitis (localized rash and pruritus) may be treated symptomatically. If no improvement is seen in 1 week administer topical or systemic corticosteroids. In one study of endocrinopathies, severe to life threatening endocrinopathies occurred in 1.8% (n=9) of patients, with all 9 patients having hyopituitarism and some having adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. Six of the 9 patients were hospitalized. Moderate endocrinopathies occurred in 2.3% of patients (n=12) and required hormone replacement or medical intervention. The median time of onset was 11 weeks. In symptomatic patients, withhold ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent and appropriate hormone replacement therapy.   In one study of enterocolitis in 511 patients, diarrhea of ≥ 7 stools above baseline, fever, ileus and peritoneal signs (Grade 3-5, severe, potentially fatal enterocolitis) occured in 7% (n=34) of patients treated with ipilimumab. Diarrhea of up to 6 stools above baseline, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool (Grade 2, moderate enterocolitis) occurred in 5% of patients (n=28). Intestinal perforation occurred in 1% (n=5). Death as a result of complications occurred in 0.8% (n=4). Hospitalization for severe enterocolitis occurred in 5% (n=26).  Grade 3-5 enterocolitis had a median time of onset of 7.4 weeks (with a range of 1.6-13.4 weeks). Grade 2 entercolitis had a median time of onset of 6.3 weeks (with a range of 0.3- 18.9 weeks). Treatment of 85% (n=29) of patients with Grade 3-5 enterocolitis (n=34) included high dose corticosteroids (≥ 40mg/day prednisone equivalent). Median dose used was 80mg/day of prednisone/equivalent for a median duration of 2.3 weeks (up to 13.9 weeks). Of the 34 patients, 74% experienced complete resolution, 3% progressed to Grade 2 severity, and 24% exhibited no improvement. &#13; In treatment of 28 patients with a Grade 2 enterocolitis: 25% received high dose corticosteroids for a median of 10 days; 29% of patients received a non-high dose of corticosteroids (≥ 40mg/day of prednisone/equivalent) for a median duration of 5.1 weeks; 46% did not receive systemic corticosteroids. Of the 28 patients, 79% of patients experienced complete resolution, 11% improved in severity, 11% exhibited no improvement. In patients with severe enterocolitis, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2 mg/kd/day of prednisone or an equivalent. Once patient improvement to Grade 1 or less is seen, taper the corticosteroid over at least one month. In patients with moderate enterocolitis, hold dose of ipilimumab, and initiate 0.5 mg/kd/day of prednisone or an equivalent. In another study examining immune mediated hepatitis, AST or ALT elevation of ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (severe and potentially fatal hepatotoxicity) was seen in 2% (n=8) of patients on ipilimumab. Fatal hepatic failure occurred in 0.2%. Hospitalization occurred in 0.4%. Additionally, moderate hepatotoxicity (2.5xULN >ALT or AST> 5xULN, or 1.5xULN>bilirubin>3xULN ) occurred in 2.5% (n=13). In Grade 3-5 hepatotoxicity, permanently discontinue ipilimumab, and initiate 1-2mg/kd/day of prednisone or equivalent. Once LFT show sustained improvement taper corticosteroid over 1 month. In Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, withhold ipilimumab. In pregnancy, use only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus (Category C). In studies done in monkeys, severe toxicities were observed including abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight and infant mortality. Additionally, ipilimumab has the potential to cross the placental barrier, and it is unknown if secretion into breast milk occurs. No studies have been performed to study carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.",The metabolism of ipilimumab does not involve the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Because ipilimumab is a protein it is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids by proteolytic enzymes.,"In one pharmacokinetic study of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma peak concentrations, trough concentrations, and area under the curve (AUC) were found to be dose proportional in the dosage range examined (0.3, 3, or 10mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses).",Volume of distribution at steady state = 7.21 L,"Clearance was measured to be 15.3mL/hr-16.8 mL/hr.In one pharmacokinetic study examining ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks, clearance was found to be time invariant.

Compared to insulin glargine, NPH insulin has a quicker onset of action and shorter duration of action.","The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism",Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent adverse events experienced by insulin users.,Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.,"NPH insulin is generally well and rapidly absorbed from the site of injection.

AT is the principal inhibitor of thrombin and Factor Xa5, the serine proteases that play pivotal roles in blood coagulation. AT neutralizes the activity of thrombin and Factor Xa by forming a complex which is rapidly removed from the circulation. The ability of antithrombin to inhibit thrombin and Factor Xa can be enhanced by greater than 300 to 1000 fold when AT is bound to heparin.","The toxicological profile of antithrombin (Recombinant) administered by the intravenous route as bolus injections and infusions has been evaluated in both single- and repeat-dose studies performed in rats, dogs, and monkeys across a range of doses from 2.1 to 360 mg/kg. The highest doses in the single dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were 360 mg/kg and 210 mg/kg, respectively. Toxicities observed were limited to transient injection site swelling observed in rats and dogs at the highest doses tested, and increased AST at highest dose in the dog study, both resolved during recovery period. The highest dose in the 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study in rats was 360 mg/kg/day. The toxicity at this dose was limited to transient limb swelling and local injection site bruising and swelling. The highest dose in the 14-day repeated-dose toxicity study in monkeys was 300 mg/kg/day or approximately 7-8 times human dose. Toxicities observed in female monkeys at this dose included internal bleeding, hematological changes and liver toxicity, with one out of three female animals showing multifocal hepatic necrosis.

Daratumumab also causes lysis in other cells that express CD38: myeloid-derived suppressor cells, a subset of regulatory T-cells, and NK cells. Decreases in absolute count and percentage of NK cells were observed during treatment. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts as well the percentage of total lymphocytes increased in peripheral blood and bone marrow during daratumumab treatment.","Daratumumab is an immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody against CD38 antigen. CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein of many functions, including receptor mediated adhesion, signaling, and modulation of cyclase and hydrolase activity. CD38 is expressed on many cell types and tissues, and highly expressed in haematological malignancies including multiple myeloma tumor cells. By binding CD38, daratumumab causes inhibition of tumor cell growth and induces broad-spectrum apoptosis in multiple ways: by Fc-mediated cross linking, by immune-mediate tumor cell lysis through complement dependent cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity, and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis.","Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies are transferred across the placenta. Due to its mechanism of action, daratumumab may cause fetal myeloid or lymphoid-cell depletion and decreased bone density.

It is a subcutaneous injection approved by the FDA for individuals on maximum statin therapy who still require additional LDL-cholesterol lowering. It is approved for both homozygous and heterozygous familial cholesterolemia as an adjunct to other first-line therapies. Evolocumab is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is a protein that targets LDL receptors for degradation, therefore reducing the liver’s ability to remove LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), or “bad” cholesterol, from the blood. Evolocumab is designed to bind to PCSK9 and inhibit PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors on the liver surface, resulting in more LDL receptors on the surface of the liver to remove LDL-C from the blood. Evolocumab is the second PCSK9 inhibitor on the market, first being alirocumab.",For the treatment of heterozygous/homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients on maximum tolerated statin therapy requiring additional LDL-cholesterol lowering.,"Following single subcutaneous administration of 140 mg or 420 mg of evolocumab, maximum suppression of circulating unbound PCSK9 occurred by 4 hours. Unbound PCSK9 concentrations returned toward baseline when evolocumab concentrations decreased below the limit of quantitation.","Evolocumab is a human IgG monoclonal antibody which targets PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). PCSK9 is a serine protease produced by the liver which binds LDL receptors and creates a complex to be targeted for lysosomal degradation. LDL receptors typically bind LDL-cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) for cellular reuptake, therefore the formation of these complexes with PCSK9 inhibits LDL receptor recycling to the cell surface, resulting in decreased cellular reuptake of LDL-C and increased levels of free LDL-C in the plasma. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have ""gain of function"" mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is able to bind both the normal PCSK9 and the ""gain of function"" mutant, D374Y.

IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells.

On Day 84 (4 weeks post-last dose), the observed geometric mean reduction from baseline in blood eosinophils was 64%, 78%, 84%, and 90% in the 12.5-mg SC, 75-mg IV, 125-mg SC, and 250-mg SC treatment groups, respectively. The model-predicted SC doses providing 50% and 90% of maximal reduction of blood eosinophils at Day 84 were estimated to be 11 and 99 mg, respectively. These results, along with the clinical efficacy data from the dose-ranging exacerbation trial (Trial 1) supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC in the confirmatory trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Following SC administration of mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks for 32 weeks (Trial 2), blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 40 cells/mcL, which corresponds to a geometric mean reduction of 84% compared with placebo. This magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment and was maintained throughout the treatment period","Mepolizumab is an interleukin-5 antagonist (IgG1 kappa). IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 with a dissociation constant of 100 pM, inhibiting the bioactivity of IL-5 by blocking its binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) are involved in inflammation.
